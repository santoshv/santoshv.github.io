<H1>FOCS/STOC 2024 Subreviewer Guidelines</H1>

<H2>Confidentiality and Related Issues</H2>
<ul>
    <li>All submissions must be treated as confidential. Please do not discuss the content of the submission, or even the fact of the existence of the submission and the submitted paper's results or techniques with anyone outside of the PC member who asked you for this review. Once the paper is publicly available you can discuss its contents, but not anything related to the fact that it was submitted to STOC/FOCS.</li>
    <li>If you have an ongoing or unpublished work that is closely related to the submission, and that may be affected by accept/reject decisions on the submission, please declare a strong COI and notify the PC member who requested the review.</li>
    <li>You should not use ideas/problems/directions suggested in a submission in your work, at least until the paper becomes publicly available.</li>
</ul>

<H2>Author clarifications/Direct questions to authors</H2>
<p>We are implementing a <b>continuous</b> author-PC feedback loop. As you are reviewing the paper, if you have a question you would like to get clarified by the authors, please contact the PC member who asked you for the review by email or through HotCRP. These could be questions about correctness of claims, or about the relation to prior work  Please be as specific as possible. The PC member will decide whether to forward your question to the authors or not. If the answer to the question is critical for you to complete your assessment, CONTACT THE PC MEMBER IMMEDIATELY, as they will be able to forward your query.  There is also a field in the HotCRP review form called "Questions for Authors".  This is visible to the authors, and you may additionally put your questions there.</p> 

<H2>Double-blindness: what it means in practice</H2>
<p>The authors should not be visible to you. If you have been asked to review a paper that you are an author of, please declare a COI -- there is no need to mention anything beyond this. In particular, please do not respond by saying that you are an author of the paper.</p>

<p>The notion of <b>hard</b> vs. <b>soft</b> COI is stated below. You should not review a paper if you have a hard COI. Since PC members and other reviewers cannot see author names, it is possible that you may have been asked to review a paper with which you have a COI. If you later realize the identity of the authors (e.g. you see a talk, or you saw the paper on arXiv) and at that point realize that you have a hard COI, <i></i>notify the PC member who contacted you immediately to have the paper reassigned</i>. Also, to maximize the unbiasing effects of double-blindness, reviewers should not intentionally attempt to de-anonymize papers for which they don’t already know the authors (e.g. by searching for the paper title on Google or arXiv).</p>

<H2>Conflict of Interest (COI)</H2>
A <b>hard</b> COI is one of the following categories:
<ul>
    <li>You, a family member, or a close friend.</li>
    <li>Ph.D. advisor or advisee (no time limit), or postdoctoral or undergraduate mentor or mentee within the past five years.</li>
    <li>Same institutional affiliation.</li>
    <li>Involved in an alleged harassment incident. (It is not required that the incident be reported.)</li>
    <li>Reviewer owes the author a favor (e.g., recently requested a reference letter).</li>
    <li>Frequent/recent collaborator, or recipient of joint funding (within 2 years) whom you believe you cannot review objectively.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have a hard COI you should not be reviewing the paper.</p>

<p>A <b>soft</b> COI occurs when the reviewer does not feel that they are biased but there can be a perception of bias.   For example, when the reviewer is a recent coauthor or collaborator of one of the authors, is otherwise vested in their success, or when the reviewer has a submission to the same conference on the same/closely related topic as the paper in question. If you have a soft COI, use your judgment on whether you want to review the paper. Do so only if you feel you can still be objective in your evaluation, or at least provide unbiased factual information. If you choose to review a paper with a soft COI, you must disclose the soft COI in the review form. </p>

<H2>Opt-Out Policy for Journals</H2>
<p>If this paper is accepted to the conference, the editor for a journal submission of the paper may later, to improve review speed and quality, ask the program committee chair for the names of the conference reviewers. This does not include release of the reviews. You may opt out of this policy by contacting the program committee chair.</p>

What is this paper's "claim to fame"?  Is it going to spark interest in further work?</li>

    <li><b>What are the paper weaknesses?</b> Lack of originality, small increment over previous work, unsubstantiated claims, bad presentation, insufficient discussion of relation with prior work etc. IF THERE IS AN ISSUE OF CORRECTNESS, please contact the PC member who assigned you the paper as soon as possible. </li>
